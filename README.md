# University Project for "Data Science and Machine Learning" Course

In a group of three we carried out a small-scale data science project along the lines of the first five stages of the CRISP Data Science Process for the "Data Science and Machine Learning" course.
The five stages include:

1. Business Understanding & Data Understanding: As a first step, find a mobility dataset
   that you would like to focus your project on. After deciding on a dataset, familiarize yourself with the domain and the data. Finally, define a specific prediction problem. More specifically, you should either select one of the variables as your prediction target or generate a prediction target from the raw data.
2. Data Preparation: After selecting a dataset and defining your prediction problem, prepare the raw data by conducting data cleaning steps discussed during the workshops and lectures (e.g. dealing with missing values, categorical features etc.). You should also augment your dataset by engineering relevant features and potentially enriching your dataset with information from other data sources. After completing data preparation, you should have a clean dataset containing all relevant features to conduct your predictive analysis.
3. Modeling & Evaluation: Using your prepared dataset, develop a suitable model for your prediction problem defined during Step 1. More specifically, select and implement two different algorithms. Afterwards, evaluate and compare your models' performances using suitable evaluation metrics.
