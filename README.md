# University Project for "Data Science and Machine Learning" Course

In a group of three we carried out a small-scale data science project along the lines of the first five stages of the CRISP Data Science Process for the "Data Science and Machine Learning" course.
The five stages include:

1. Business Understanding & 2. Data Understanding: As a first step, find a mobility dataset
   that you would like to focus your project on.
2. Data Preparation: After selecting a dataset and defining your prediction problem, prepare the raw data by conducting data cleaning steps discussed during the workshops and lectures (e.g. dealing with missing values, categorical features etc.). You should also augment your dataset by engineering relevant features and potentially enriching your dataset with information from other data sources. After completing data preparation, you should have a clean dataset containing all relevant features to conduct your predictive analysis.
